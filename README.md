## Del Norte Food Ordering Service
This project was created by Kyle, Charlie, Yajat, and Eric. Our coding skills are rudimentary so any and all contributions will be welcomed. We will
judge each contribution. Our project is dedicated to helping our school, Del Norte High School, serve a smooth lunch experience. Its purpose is to allow students to order food from school online in order to reduce lunch line congestion. Our project uses Thymeleaf to fuse java and html elements. The project is publicly accessible on the web. To run the program, find main.java and run it.

## TBD [Spring Portfolio Starter](https://nighthawkcodingsociety.com/projectsearch/details/Spring%20Portfolio%20Starter)
Runtime link: TBD https://jportfolio.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/



## Visual thoughts
#### * Starter code should be fun and practical
#### * Organize with Bootstrap menu 
#### * Add some color and fun through VANTA Visuals (birds, halo, solar, net)
#### * Show some practical and fun links (hrefs) like Twitter, Git, YouTube
#### * Show student project specific links (hrefs) per page
#### * Show student TPT ideas
#### * Show student About me page



## Getting started
#### * Clone project to IntelliJ
#### * Verify Project Structure to use a good Java JDK (adopt-openJ9-15) 
#### * Play or entry point is Main.java, look for play option in the tray.  This file enables Spring to load
#### * Java source (src/main/java) had Java files.  Find "controllers" path, these files enable HTTP route and HTML file relationship.  Note, html 
#### * HTML source (src/main/resources) had templates and supporting files.  Find index.html as this file is launched by default in Spring.  Other HTML files are loaded by building a "@Controller"



## IDE management
#### * A ".gitignore" can teach a Developer a lot about Java runtime.  A target directory is created when you press play button, byte code is generated and files are moved into this location.
#### * A "pom.xml" file can teach you a lot about Java dependencies.  This is similar to "requirements.txt" file in Python.  It manages packages and dependencies.
